# PR Notes Organiser

This is a website for organising notes when reviewing PRs. The current markdown editor on github is rather small making comments difficult to format, therefore this organiser can be used to track issues while reviewing. The website was developed in such a way to make future implementation with a server a simple process - should be as simple as adding API calls which return the same data as the cookie helper
